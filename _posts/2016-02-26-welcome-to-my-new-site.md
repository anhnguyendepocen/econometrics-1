Welcome to my new web site, created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/). My other [site](http://eml.berkeley.edu//~bgraham/) is getting a bit clumsy and difficult to navigate. Eventually it will be easier to find materials on this site. I say "eventually" because this site is currently a work in progress. In putting together this site I found the following [tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/) rather helpful.

While I don't expect to do so often, I will use this blog to ocassionally post about my research, teaching and other activities.
