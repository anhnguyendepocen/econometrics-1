To reproduce the estimation sample used in "Identification and estimation 
of average partial effects in `irregular' correlated random coefficient panel data
models" (by Bryan S. Graham and James L. Powell) extract the files -- preserving the directory structure -- in the "RPS_Data_Extract_Replication" zip archive. 

In the "Nicaragua_IFPRI_Data" subdirectory is
a Stata Do file called "calorie_demand_analysis". Edit the directory pointers at the
top of this do file to point to the extraction directory. If you execute this file
you should then reproduce the estimation sample used in our paper. 

The "RPS_Data_Extract_Replication" zip archive includes the source data files from the 
IFPRI (2005) public release of the RPS evaluation dataset. It also includes calorie 
content data and various other auxiliary files.
